# Chaldal-Warehouse
<h3>Live Site: <a target="_blank" href="https://chaldal-warehouse.web.app/">Chaldal Warehouse</a></h3>
<h5>Hello!</h5>
<p>I have made a website related warehouse. Where an item can be added, as well as that item can be updated. For example, the quantity of the item can be increased or the quantity can be reduced by delivery. All data will be updated in the database immediately. You can even delete an item if you want. Which is a Mern-Stack website. 

<br/> For complete this site I have used some technology and I
        also want to tell what service anyone can get from this website.</p>
<h5>Actually This is a warehouse related website where someone can--</h5>
<ul>
        <li>
        In home page there have some section like Navbar(for routing), banner(use animation for get real time feel, about section, item section, contact section and also a footer section.
        </li>
        <li>
                As this is a warehouse related website so easily can add any new item, and it will be include in database and immediately update automatics. 
        </li>
        <li>
                If need to deliver any time, then can deliver it and reduce quantity by one.
        </li>
        <li>
                Here also a option for stock any specific item form where take a number and then it will stock again. Its also update in database.
        </li>
        <li>
        Without login or registration no one can update any item or delete any item as well as can't stock any item as these route is private.
        </li>
        <li>
        As this is realtime database related work, so I used JWT token for secure data, so without authentication no one can access data.
